PasSFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for Pascal

audio and network.
It is originally written in C++, and this project is an inofficial binding for the Pascal language. It makes use of the C wrappers from the CSFML bindings.

Download

Currently Delphi and FPC/Lazarus are supported. However, due to a compiler incompatibility with the Delphi compiler (solved with workarounds), FPC is recommended at the moment.
